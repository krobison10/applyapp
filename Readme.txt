This program stores information about job application for multiple users. 

The primary function for creating this database is to keep track of companies
at which the user has already applied. With APP.ly users can quickly access all
the jobs they’ve applied for along with various information regarding each application.
This database holds information about the date at which the application was 
submitted for the user, the job board at which the position was initially advertised,
company name, application status, job type, job name, salary, links to the employer’s website,
employer contact information, username/password for their account, and any files
associated with the application. Users can sort the database based on date submitted,
the company name, or by the application status. Some of the fields are subfields of
other fields, such as company details being a subset of company name
and job description being a subset of position name.
